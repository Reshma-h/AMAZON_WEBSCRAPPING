# AMAZON_WEBSCRAPPING
Extracting raw data from amazon by importing selenium and predicting analysis

Project Title: Amazon Product Analysis and Sales Prediction
Overview:
In this project, we will be using Selenium, a web automation tool, to extract product data from Amazon's website. Then we will perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to predict the future sales of products.
Technical Requirements:
●	Python
●	Selenium
●	Pandas
●	NumPy
●	Matplotlib
●	Scikit-learn
●	Jupyter Notebook
Project Steps:
1.	Data Collection: Use Selenium to scrape data from Amazon's website, specifically the product page of a category or a specific product. Collect data such as product name, price, reviews, rating, features, and other relevant information.
2.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing any duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant information. Perform preprocessing tasks such as text cleaning, data normalization, and feature scaling to prepare the data for analysis.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data. Use statistical techniques and visualizations to gain insights into the data, such as the distribution of prices, ratings, reviews, and other relevant features.
4.	Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps to communicate the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis. Use tools such as Matplotlib to create the visualizations.
5.	Machine Learning Model: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm such as linear regression, decision tree, or random forest to predict the future sales of products. Train the model on the cleaned and preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of Selenium for web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning in Python. By predicting future sales of products, the project can help businesses make informed decisions and optimize their sales strategies.
